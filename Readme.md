Welcome to this year's HTML challenge for Hacktoberfest ([What is Hacktoberfest?](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/hacktoberfest-2019#what-is-hacktoberfest)). A project with beginners and aspiring developers in mind, utilizing HTML, CSS & maybe a dash of JavaScript to achieve a simplistic yet elegant Christmas themed website.

- HTML elements
- CSS styling
- Images
- Text/Copy
- Documentation
- Fix Typos, Code Bugs or Accessibility oversights

## Project Brief

Over the years Santa Claus has noticed a decline in the Christmas spirit and is in desperate need of our help! Santa and his elves have put together a [basic design concept](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Santafied/tree/master/design) for a brand new website they want to be able to launch in November.

- [ ] Gift suggestions for secret santas
- [ ] Lyrics for Christmas songs :musical_note:
