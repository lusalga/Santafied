                      [Chorus]<br>
                      Last Christmas, I gave you my heart<br>
                      But the very next day you gave it away<br>
                      This year, to save me from tears<br>
                      I'll give it to someone special<br>
                      Last Christmas, I gave you my heart<br>
                      But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)<br>
                      This year, to save me from tears<br>
                      I'll give it to someone special (Special)<br>
                      <br>
                      [Verse 1]<br>
                      Once bitten and twice shy<br>
                      I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye<br>
                      Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?<br>
                      Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me<br>
                      <br>
                      [Verse 2]<br>
                      (Happy Christmas) I wrapped it up and sent it<br>
                      With a note saying, "I love you", I meant it<br>
                      Now I know what a fool I've been<br>
                      But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again<br>
                      <br>
                      [Chorus]<br>
                      Last Christmas, I gave you my heart<br>
                      But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)<br>
                      This year, to save me from tears<br>
                      I'll give it to someone special (Special)<br>
                      Last Christmas, I gave you my heart<br>

                      This year, to save me from tears<br>
                      I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)<br>
                      Oh, oh, baby<br>
                      <br>
                      [Verse 3]<br>
                      A crowded room, friends with tired eyes<br>
                      I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice<br>
                      My God, I thought you were someone to rely on<br>
                      Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on<br>
                      <br>
                      [Verse 4]<br>
                      A face on a lover with a fire in his heart<br>
                      A man under cover but you tore me apart<br>
                      Ooh-hoo<br>
                      Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again<br>
                      <br>
                      [Chorus]<br>
                      Last Christmas, I gave you my heart<br>
                      But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)<br>
                      This year, to save me from tears<br>
                      I'll give it to someone special (Special)<br>
                      Last Christmas, I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)<br>
                      But the very next day you gave it away (You gave me away)<br>
                      This year, to save me from tears (Ohh)<br>
                      I'll give it to someone special (Special)<br>
                      <br>
                      [Outro]<br>

                      A man under cover but you tore him apart<br>
                      Maybe next year<br>
                      I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special<br>
                      Special...<br>
                      Someone...<br>

                      I just want you for my own<br>
                      More than you could ever know<br>

                      Don't care about the presents<br>
                      Underneath the Christmas tree<br>
                      I don't need to hang my stocking<br>
                      There upon the fireplace (I)<br>
                      Santa Claus won't make me happy<br>

                      To the North Pole for Saint Nick (I)<br>
                      I won't even stay awake to<br>

                      So brightly everywhere (So brightly, baby)<br>
                      And the sound of children's<br>
                      Laughter fills the air (Oh, oh)<br>
                      And everyone is singing (Oh, yeah)<br>
                      I hear those sleigh bells ringing (Yeah, oh)<br>
                      Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh, oh)<br>
                      Won't you please bring my baby to me?, yeah<br>

                    <p class="card-text">
                      Jingle Bells is one of the best-known and commonly sung American songs in the world. It was
                      written by James Lord Pierpont (1822–1893) and published under the title "One Horse Open Sleigh"
                      in the autumn of 1857. It has been claimed that it was originally written to be sung by a Sunday
                      school choir; however, historians dispute this, stating that it was much too "racy" (and secular)
                      to be sung by a children's church choir in the days it was written.

                      And soon, Miss Fanny Bright<br>
                      Was seated by my side<br>
                      The horse was lean and lank<br>
                      Misfortune seemed his lot<br>
                      He got into a drifted bank<br>
                      And then we got upsot<br>

                      "Run, Rudolph, Run" is a Christmas song popularized by Chuck Berry, written by Johnny Marks 
                       and Marvin Brodie and published by St. Nicholas Music (ASCAP). The song was first recorded
                       by Berry in 1958 and released as a single on Chess Records. It has since been covered by numerous
                       other artists, sometimes with the title "Run, Run, Rudolph". The song is a 12-bar blues, musically 
                       similar to Berry's very popular and recognizable song "Johnny B. Goode" and melodically identical to 
                       his song "Little Queenie", released in 1959.

                      Santa Baby is a 1953 Christmas song written by Joan Javits (the niece of Senator Jacob K. Javits)
                      and Philip Springer, sung originally by Eartha Kitt. The song is a tongue-in-cheek look at a
                      Christmas list addressed to Santa Claus by a woman who wants extravagant gifts such as sables,
                      yachts, and decorations from Tiffany's.

                      "Jingle Bell Rock" is an American popular Christmas song first released by Bobby Helms in 1957 
                      (after it was recorded in October of that year). It has received frequent airplay in the United States 
                      during every Christmas season since then. "Jingle Bell Rock" was composed by Joseph Carleton Beal (1900–1967) 
                      and James Ross Boothe (1917–1976). Beal was a Massachusetts-born public relations professional and 
                      longtime resident of South Ocean Avenue in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Boothe was an American writer in 
                      the advertising business.

                      "Feliz Navidad" is a Christmas song written in 1970 by the Puerto Rican singer and songwriter José Feliciano. With its simple Spanish chorus (the traditional Christmas/ New Year greeting, "Feliz Navidad, próspero año y felicidad" meaning "Merry Christmas, a prosperous year and happiness") and equally simple English verse "I wanna wish you a Merry Christmas from the bottom of my heart", it has become a classic Christmas pop song.

                    <h5>Lyrics</h5>
                    <p>
                      You know Dasher and Dancer<br>
                      And Prancer and Vixen<br>
                      Comet and Cupid<br>
                      And Donner and Blitzen<br>
                      But do you recall<br>
                      The most famous reindeer of all?<br>
                      <br>
                      Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer<br>
                      (reindeer)<br>
                      Had a very shiny nose<br>
                      (like a light bulb)<br>
                      And if you ever saw it<br>
                      (saw it)<br>
                      You would even say it glows<br>
                      (like a flash light)<br>
                      All of the other reindeer<br>
                      (reindeer)<br>
                      Used to laugh and call him names<br>
                      (like Pinocchio)<br>
                      They never let poor Rudolph<br>
                      (Rudolph)<br>
                      Play in any reindeer games<br>
                      (like Monopoly)<br>
                      <br>
                      Then one foggy Christmas Eve<br>
                      Santa came to say<br>
                      (Ho Ho Ho)<br>
                      Rudolph with your nose so bright<br>
                      Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?<br>
                      Then all the reindeer loved him<br>
                      (loved him)<br>
                      And they shouted out with glee<br>
                      (yippee)<br>
                      "Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer<br>
                      (reindeer)<br>
                      You'll go down in history!"<br>
                      (like Columbus)<br>
